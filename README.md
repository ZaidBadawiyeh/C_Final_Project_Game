# Object-Oriented Interactive Game in C++

Welcome to my interactive game project implemented in C++! This project utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create an engaging and entertaining gaming experience. Players are immersed in a world where they can interact with potions, health, money, an item shop, NPCs, and engage in trivia questions for added excitement.

## Motivation

As a passionate programmer and gaming enthusiast, I was inspired to develop an interactive game that incorporates various elements of gameplay to keep players entertained. Leveraging the power of object-oriented programming allowed me to create a modular and flexible game architecture that can easily scale and evolve over time.

## How It Works

The game features several key components:

- **Player Character:** Players control a character with attributes such as health, money, and inventory.
- **Potions:** Players can collect and use potions to restore health or gain special abilities.
- **Item Shop:** An in-game shop where players can purchase items using in-game currency.
- **NPCs:** Non-player characters interact with the player, offering quests, items, or challenges.
- **Trivia Questions:** Players encounter trivia questions throughout the game, adding an educational and interactive element to the gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game is built using object-oriented programming principles, making the codebase modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
  
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players have the freedom to explore the game world, interact with NPCs, purchase items, and engage in trivia questions, creating a dynamic and immersive gaming experience.

- **Educational Component:** The inclusion of trivia questions adds an educational aspect to the game, providing players with the opportunity to learn while having fun.


## Conclusion

This interactive game project demonstrates the power of object-oriented programming in creating engaging and entertaining gaming experiences. By combining elements such as potions, health, money, an item shop, NPCs, and trivia questions, players are immersed in a rich and interactive game world. I thoroughly enjoyed developing this project and hope that players will find it both enjoyable and educational. Feel free to explore the code and embark on your gaming adventure!
